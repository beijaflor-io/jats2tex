				<title>ABSTRACT:</title>
				<p>The aim of this study was to analyze the incidence of caries, in relation to
					maternal risk behaviors and clinical conditions representing different levels of
					sickle cell disease severity. A total of 295 children aged 6 to 60 months
					participated in this cohort conducted from August 2007 to December 2008. They
					were diagnosed and monitored by the referral service of the state. Interviews
					were made with families to identify sociodemographic variables, and an oral exam
					was performed to determine dental caries. The SRQ (Self Report Questionnaire)
					scale was used to diagnose the presence of common mental disorders, and the CAGE
					(Cut down, Annoyed, Guilty and Eye opener) was applied to determine abusive use
					of alcohol. The absolute and relative frequencies of the variables of interest
					were analyzed by Chi-square and Mann-Whitney, with a 5% significance level. The
					incidence variables were analyzed according to the logistic regression model,
					with a confidence interval of 95%. Caries incidence (1.98; SD = 4.68) was higher
					in the HbSS genotype. There was a statistically significant association between
					caries incidence and both abusive use of alcohol (32.43%, RR = 1.99; 1.05-3.78;
					95%CI) and common mental disorders (8.77% RR = 0.37; 0.15-0.93; 95%CI). There
					was also an association between caries incidence and maternal risk behavior,
					indicating that the care network should be expanded to include patients with
					sickle cell disease.</p>

			<title>Introduction</title>
			<p>Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is the most prevalent hemoglobinopathy in
					Brazil<sup>(</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is
				estimated that 3500 new cases are diagnosed each year. Bahia has the highest
				prevalence of sickle cell disease (1:650) <sup>(</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1"
					>1</xref><sup>)</sup> of all the Brazilian states. SCA is hereditary,
				characterized by autosomal recessive genes, and is caused by a mutation on
				chromosome 11. This leads to a structural modification responsible for changes in
				the stability, solubility and structure of erythrocytes, which take on a sickle
				shape when exposed to low oxygen tension, acidosis or dehydration <sup>(</sup><xref
					ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref><sup>), (</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3"
					>3</xref><sup>), (</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p>
			<p>Pediatric patients usually have a history of multiple hospitalizations for pain
				crises, episodes of severe anemia, blood transfusions and recurrent periods of
				pulmonary infections. Children constitute the age group most vulnerable to severe
				symptoms, especially when diagnosed with the HbSS genotype <sup>(</sup><xref
					ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p>
			<p>In the oral cavity, SCA can cause diastemata, delays in tooth eruption,
					<sup>(</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref><sup>), (</sup><xref
					ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref><sup>), (</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7"
					>7</xref><sup>)</sup> malocclusion and glossitis. <sup>(</sup><xref
					ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref><sup>), (</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7"
					>7</xref><sup>), (</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref><sup>),
					(</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref><sup>)</sup> There are no studies
				in the literature containing conclusive data related to the prevalence of caries and
				periodontal disease in children afflicted by SCA, <sup>(</sup><xref ref-type="bibr"
					rid="B10">10</xref><sup>), (</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1"
					>1</xref><sup>)</sup> despite the existence of biological plausibility for an
				association between incidence of caries and severity of the disease.</p>
			<p>It is reported that the quality of life and the children’s family situation are
				critical in determining the process of health and disease. <sup>(</sup><xref
					ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref><sup>)</sup> The greater incidence of dental
				caries in children is connected to a poorly structured family context, as well as
				worse health conditions in socially marginalized areas.<sup>(</sup><xref
					ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref><sup>)</sup> These phenomena are also observed
				in regard to the impact that a chronic illness has on a family. <sup>(</sup><xref
					ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref><sup>)</sup> A worse family context can be
				observed when the mother is an alcoholic or/and has a common mental disorder.
					<sup>(</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref><sup>)</sup> Both conditions
				characterize maternal risk behaviors, <sup>(</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2"
					>2</xref><sup>), (</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref><sup>)</sup> and
				are associated with a higher caries experience in children. <sup>(</sup><xref
					ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref><sup>), (</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5"
					>5</xref><sup>)</sup>
			</p>
			<p>The aim of this study was to associate dental caries incidence to maternal risk
				behaviors and clinical conditions representing the levels of severity of this
				disease (presence of HbSS genotype, occurrence of pain crises, need for
				hospitalization and blood transfusions) by performing six-month follow-up studies on
				children aged 06-60 months, diagnosed and monitored by the state of Bahia’s referral
				service from August 2007 to December 2008.</p>
		</sec>
		<sec sec-type="methods">
			<title>Methodology</title>
			<p>A prospective cohort study was conducted. The population was established in August
				2007 with children aged at least 6 months, who did not present with a history
				showing clinically severe conditions (hospitalization and blood transfusion) and
				were regularly monitored by the <italic>Serviço de Hematologia da Divisão de Triagem
					Neonatal</italic> of <italic>Associação dos Pais e Amigos dos
					Excepcionais</italic> - APAE (the Association of Parents and Friends of
				Exceptional Children) in Salvador-BA, the only service accredited by the
					<italic>Ministério da Saúde</italic> - MS and the <italic>Secretaria de Saúde da
					Bahia</italic> - SESAB as a referral center for the treatment, diagnosis and
				screening of neonates in the state.</p>
			<p>The inclusion criteria comprised a minimum age of six months, diagnostic confirmation
				of sickle cell disease, at least two clinical consultations at the health service
				with an interval of at least 6 months - when interviews/caries examinations were
				conducted - and complete information regarding both the children’s primary risk
				variables and the outcome variable. The exclusion criteria comprised inability to
				meet the above requirements and refusal to participate in the study. A total of 409
				children, 41.9% of the initial sample, were excluded after missing appointments
				scheduled by the referral service. These cases made it difficult to perform a
				follow-up, and, consequently, presented a bias in the survey.</p>
			<p>In all, 295 children were followed until December 2008, representing one year and 6
				months for this cohort. Each child was assessed twice with an average interval of 8
				months. The exams and the interview took place during the child’s regular visit to
				the health service.</p>
			<p>After signing the terms of informed consent, parents or guardians were asked
				questions related to socioeconomic status (skin color, family income, level of
				maternal education, age of mother and child, marital status), sickle-cell-related
				clinical conditions (morbidity in the last six months, pain crises, hospitalization
				and blood transfusion, as well as the genotype of the disease); and maternal risk
				behavior (common mental health disorders, alcohol abuse).</p>
			<p>The genotype was informed by the child’s guardian and confirmed by the medical
				records. “Common mental health disorder” was diagnosed if eight or more questions on
				the Self Report Questionnaire - SRQ-20<sup>(</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6"
					>6</xref><sup>)</sup> received a positive response. In respect to the variable
				of “alcohol abuse,” a positive response to two or more questions on the CAGE
					scale<sup>(</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref><sup>)</sup> indicated
				its consideration. These questionnaires were validated in previous studies carried
				out in Brazil. <sup>(</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref><sup>),
					(</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref><sup>)</sup>
			</p>
			<p>While awaiting their appointment with the hematologist, the children participated in
				oral health education activities (supervised brushing and guidance on oral hygiene)
				and were examined for dental caries according to the criteria established by the
				Oral Health Brazil<sup>(</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref><sup>)</sup>
				survey.</p>
			<p>A change in the child’s health status was considered an incidental event. In relation
				to dental caries, this meant the development of another manifestation of the
				disease; in relation to the clinical conditions assessed and the variables related
				to maternal behavior, it meant any new events. </p>
			<p>The data were collected by three trained and previously calibrated teams.
				Verification of inter-examiner and intra-examiner conformity identified a general
				agreement of 98% for caries and a kappa of 0.79. </p>
			<p>The absolute and relative frequencies of the variables of interest were analyzed
				using the Chi-square test. The Mann-Whitney tests measured the probability of a
				statistically significant difference between the median dmft - the number of
				decayed, missing and filled teeth - at baseline and at follow-up, as well as the
				probability of association between the median incidence of caries and the genotype.
				In this case, individuals who did not have the HbSS and HbSC genotypes were
				excluded. A significance level of 5% was used in these tests.</p>
			<p>The association measure used was relative risk (RR) with a confidence interval of
				95%. The main outcome was dichotomized (individuals with new caries = 1; individuals
				without new caries = 0). The variables that were associated with the outcome in the
				univariate model, and that showed a p-value less than or equal to 0.05, were
				analyzed using the multiple Poisson regression model.</p>
			<p>The data was tabulated using Epi Info 6.04<sup>&#x00ae;</sup> (CDC, Atlanta, USA),
				and the statistical analysis was performed using Stata<sup>&#x00ae;</sup>, version
				12.0 (StataCorp LP, College Station, USA).</p>
			<p>The research protocol for the study was submitted to and approved by the Research
				Ethics Committee of the <italic>Maternidade Climério de Oliveira</italic>
					(<italic>Universidade Federal da Bahia</italic> - UFBa), under number 014/2007.
				There are no conflicts of interest with the institution where the research was
				conducted (APAE/Salvador). </p>

			<title>Results</title>
			<p>A total of 295 children were followed. Their ages ranged from 6 to 60 months, with a
				mean age of 32.92 months (SD = 17.31). Of this total, 145 were males (49.15%) and
				150 were females (50.85%). Most were classified as brown (54.80%), residing in the
				countryside (76.62%), and with a family income below the minimum wage (74.40%). As
				for genotype, 33.78% were HbSS, 51.35% were HbSC and 14.87% belonged to other
				genotypes of less clinical relevance, and, for this reason, were not detailed in
				this investigation.</p>
			<p>In respect to the children’s family setting, the mother’s average age was 26 years;
				54.36% of the mothers had completed elementary and middle school, and 76.41% were
				married or had a common-law union with a partner. During the study period, 19.32% of
				new cases of common mental disorders and 12.54% of new cases of maternal alcohol
				abuse were identified in this group.</p>
			<p>The variables for the clinical manifestations of the disease, <italic>i.e.</italic>,
				presence of pain crises, need for hospitalization and blood transfusion, showed an
				incidence of 22.03%, 14.92% and 8.47%, respectively. The degree of clinical
				vulnerability of the studied population becomes more evident when observing that a
				respective 70.85% (pain crisis), 55.17% (hospitalization) and 28.73% (blood
				transfusion) of the patients had a history of these events occurring at least once
				from the baseline through the entire study period, according to the morbidity.</p>
			<p>Description of dmft according to sickle cell condition showed that the HbSS group had
				a greater incidence of caries than the HbSC. There was no statistically significant
				association between the incidence of caries and the genotype (p-value = 0.34). On
				the other hand, there was a statistically significant difference between the
				baseline median dmft values (0.00, 0.00-0.00) and the follow-up values (0.00,
				0.00-2.00) (p-value = 0.00), revealing an increase in caries not associated with the
				genotype of the disease over time.</p>
			<p>Among the variables that represent clinical severity, the occurrence of a pain crisis
				as a risk factor was associated to the higher incidence of caries only in the crude
				analysis (RR = 1.89, 95%CI 1.01-3.58). In relation to maternal behavior variables,
				maternal alcohol abuse (RR = 1.90, 95%CI 1.11-3.25) and common mental disorders (RR
				= 0.40, 95%CI 0.17-0.98) were associated to outcome. These results were confirmed in
				the adjusted model.</p>

			<title>Discussion</title>
			<p>This study examined the caries incidence, clinical conditions and maternal risk
				behavior of 295 children between 6 and 60 months of age, with sickle cell disease,
				who were followed in a six-month cohort. No cohort studies were found in the
				literature which examined the clinical conditions and the family context; moreover,
				none related the impact of these conditions to the oral health of this group group

			<p>It is difficult to compare the results regarding oral health, because there are no
				other caries incidence studies in patients with sickle cell disease. Only two
				articles were found in the literature that investigated dental caries in children
				with sickle cell disease, both of which are cross-sectional studies. One described
				the clinical and oral health conditions, the socioeconomic status and the family
				context of 704 children in the state of Bahia, Brazil,<xref ref-type="bibr"
					rid="B10">10</xref> and the other associated caries prevalence to socioeconomic
				status in 160 children in Recife, Brazil.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">11</xref>
				The dmft in these studies was 0.94 (DP = &#x00b1;2.28) and 2.12, respectively. In
				the National Oral Health Survey (SB Brazil) of 2003, <sup>(</sup><xref
					ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref><sup>)</sup> the mean dmft for healthy
				Brazilian children aged 18-36 months was 1.07 (SD = 2.40) and 1.00 (SD = 2.24) in
				the northeast region. As for the 5 year-old age group, the dmft recorded in the SB
				Brazil 2010<sup>(</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref><sup>)</sup> was 2.43
				(95%CI 2.22-2.63) for the country and 1.70 (95%CI 1.36-2.04) for the city of
				Salvador, the Bahia state capital where the research was conducted. In the present
				study, the dmft of the follow-up group (2.69, SD = 5.23) was higher than that of
				Brazil and that of Bahia.</p>
			<p>According to the literature, <sup>(</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2"
					>2</xref><sup>), (</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref><sup>)</sup>
				sickle cell disease does not predispose individuals to caries, at least not
				directly. In the two articles found in the literature referred to above, there was
				no statistically significant association between caries incidence and genotype. HbSS
				showed a higher caries incidence, as was observed in other studies with
					adults<sup>(</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref><sup>), (</sup><xref
					ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref><sup>)</sup> and adolescents, <sup>(</sup><xref
					ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref><sup>)</sup> as compared with the HbSC
				genotype and control groups. Ralstrom<sup>(</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1"
					>1</xref><sup>)</sup> attributed this association to the lower severity of
				clinical manifestations of the HbSC <italic>versus</italic> the HbSS genotype.</p>
			<p>Despite the lack of association between the incidence of caries and the genotype for
				more severe disease, it was found that the morbidity for pain crises was a risk
				factor for caries incidence. Pain crisis is the most common clinical event and the
				primary reason for seeking medical services and hospitalization; <sup>(</sup><xref
					ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref><sup>)</sup> for this reason, the children
				reporting this symptom in this study were considered as having a greater degree of
				severity than those who never presented it. Pain crisis was the event that most
				contributed to a greater burden of disease on Cameroonian parents. <sup>(</sup><xref
					ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref><sup>)</sup>
			</p>
			<p>In respect to this severe clinical profile, Guimarães and collaborators, in their
				study on the daily lives of families of children and adolescents with sickle cell
				disease, reported that mothers tend to be overprotective and burdened when they need
				to spend time caring for their children and have to give up social functions. An
				impact on the family environment was also reported in this study, namely the
				inability to accept the disease and the fear of death, to the extent that the family
				experienced periods of greater or lesser control of the disease and could not handle
				the situation, feeling lost and hopeless.</p>
			<p>According to Martin and Angelo, <sup>(</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7"
					>7</xref><sup>)</sup> the mother is largely responsible for family health in
				low-income communities, since she represents the center of the family. It is the
				mother who plays the leading role in controlling important variables which determine
				caries, such as eating habits and oral hygiene. Accordingly, the variables related
				to maternal behavior - the presence of common mental disorders and alcohol abuse -
				are important factors in constructing the family context. In this study, maternal
				risk behavior variables were associated with caries incidence. This goes to show how
				family background affects the oral health of these children.</p>
			<p>Sousa <italic>et al</italic>. also found an association between family dysfunction,
				resulting from common maternal mental disorder symptoms and alcoholism, and the
				incidence of caries in children aged 2-3 years with a dmft of 0.72 (SD = 1.8). </p>
			<p>It has been suggested that sickle cell disease, its social representations and its
				clinical symptoms, which tend to worsen with age, are factors that trigger and/or
				contribute to building a negative family environment, and, consequently, to a
				worsening in oral health.</p>
			<p>Despite the relevance of sickle cell disease to the general and oral health of
				stricken children, the limitations of this study are worth noting, including the
				convenience of the sample, which consisted of those requiring health services and
				already receiving medical and dental care. As a result, it is important to note that
				the sample does not allow inference of these results to all patients with sickle
				cell disease, only to the sample population.</p>
			<p>Another consideration is that that sample size represented not only a limitation, but
				also a difficulty, since case follow-up was dependent on the patients’ return for a
				follow-up appointment with the hematologist. Thus, the sample may not have been
				enough for some variables to become more expressive. Furthermore, the strategy of
				bivariate analysis for caries incidence was adopted because caries was the most
				important oral manifestation, but further studies should not discard the existence
				of other associations.</p>
		</sec>
		<sec sec-type="conclusions">
			<title>Conclusions</title>
			<p>In this sample, an association between the incidence of caries and maternal behavior
				(alcohol abuse, maternal depression) was verified. The results also give indications
				of the association between sickle cell disease severity and a higher caries
				incidence, a finding that should be followed up in subsequent studies to confirm
				this relationship.</p>
			<p>The significant loss of patients between the baseline and the follow-up suggests that
				there may be significant barriers in accessing the state’s referral center. Studies
				on the access to these services still lack in the literature, indicating that
				further evaluation is required.</p>
